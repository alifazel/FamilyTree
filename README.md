# FamilyTree (Laravel-based)

This is a reboot of the previous laravel-based Family Tree application. There will more of a strong emphasis this time to use a more cleaner and manageable database structure. A road-map has been designed to incorporate features in a modular-fashion. 

This readme.md file will be updated in the upcoming commits with the current road-map and feature wishlist. It will also serve as the primary documentation for installing this to a developmental server.
